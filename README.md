URL Change Monitor
A Python script that checks if a webpage has been updated. It compares the current last-modified date of a URL with the previous time it checked. If the page has changed, it sends an email notification.
You can set it up as a cron job to automatically check any webpage for updates on a schedule-useful for monitoring when specific pages get updated without having to check manually.
